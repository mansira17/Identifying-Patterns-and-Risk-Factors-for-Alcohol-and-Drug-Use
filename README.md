# Identifying-Patterns-and-Risk-Factors-for-Alcohol-and-Drug-Use

The project analyzes the demographic and behavioral factors influencing heavy alcohol consumption and drug use, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Alcohol and drug abuse are major public health issues with significant social and economic impacts. Understanding the predictors of heavy alcohol consumption and drug use is crucial for creating effective prevention and intervention strategies. The project employs advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to uncover patterns and insights that can inform public health efforts in addressing substance abuse. Data was obtained from various NHANES datasets from 2011 to 2018, including demographics, alcohol use, drug use, smoking habits, current health status, and cardiovascular health. The methodology involved data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning modeling using algorithms such as Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and SVM. The results identified key predictors of heavy alcohol consumption and categorized individuals into different levels of substance use. The findings emphasize the importance of targeted, evidence-based interventions to address heavy alcohol consumption and drug use, considering individual characteristics and broader social contexts. This comprehensive analysis highlights the multifaceted nature of substance abuse and the need for holistic public health strategies.
